After about a year, I have finally thought to make a genuine journal, or blog that I can edit! Thank god, now I can yap all I want about whatever I want.

Anyways,

The main purpose of this new iteration was because my old website desperately needed a rework from the ground up to actually be somewhat maintainable. That is where I decided to finally pick up learning the <u>**Astro**</u> framework after planning to for at least ***ONE AND A HALF YEARS***.

It surprisingly wasn't that bad, except for making this blog collection because I had never worked with *Typescript* in my life. Thankfully I managed to figure out that it was an issue with how I was trying to connect *Obsidian* and the collections.

The current version of this site is entirely static. I chose Astro because it's lightweight and minimal, also far more maintainable than whatever junk I had before hand. This is my first time using Astro as mentioned ever, and so far it's shaping up to be an extremely well-rounded framework, not like I would know what that would look like.

This server is hosted on Cloudflare, but I know at one point or another it'd be nice to have my own server that deploys it for me.

With this new iteration, it seems I am now able to make it extremely frictionless to add projects or whatever under `/my-work/`, same goes for adding journal/blog entries to this.

Well, with that being said, hope you enjoy these posts... I guess..?
